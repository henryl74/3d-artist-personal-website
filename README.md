# Features


My project consists of four webpages:

- Home or landing page.
- Profile page.
- Gallery page.
- Contact page.

### - The Navigation Bar

- The naviagation bar is located at the top of the page, one section displays the the artist name and role, this information is located on the left corner.
- The other navigation links of the website are on the top right hand side, these are: Home, Profile, Gallery, and Contact.
- The navigation bar is very responsive and user friendly, allows the user to find information easily in each section of the website.

- I tested the contact form with successfully results when submitted.

- I tested the validation on the contact form and works very well, name, email and phone fields are mandatory preventing the user of leaving this black or without the required information.

### - The Footer

- The footer section includes links to the relevant social media sites associated to the artist. The links open to a new tab to allow easy navigation for the user.

## Testing
---

- I tested this page in different web browsers such as: Chrome, Firefox, Safari on desktop and mobile phones respectively.
- I confirmed that this project is responsive, looks good and functions on all standard screen sizes using the DevTools device toolbar.
- I confirmed that the navigation, header, home, profile, gallery, and contact text are all rideable and easy to understand.
- I confirmed that the form works. It requires entries in every field (excluding the message), will only accept an email in the email field, and the submit button works.

## Bugs

### Solved bugs

- While testing the navegation menu before deploying my project to github, I noticed there was a problem when clicking on the profile menu from the contact one; instead of taking me to the correct destination, it took me to the home page instead.
- I discovered this was due when I copied the initial index.html file to the contact one, I forgot to update the href to "profile.html" within the anchor element.

![Screenshot of the anchor element](assets/images/anchor_code.png)

- The box I created for the profile page was out alignment at top, this due the "float left" I applied to the logo/header in my css file.
- I solved this by applying "clear left" to the box profile ID:

- The "Home" image was a little heavy and affected somehow the score for performance in lighthouse for this section of the website, I fixed this by converting the file to jpeg and reducing the size.

### Unfixed Bugs

- Due to time constraints I culd not test the site for all type of mobile phones, the site works very well in most mobile standard devices, laptops and desktop computer.


## Validator Testing

### HTML

- The first time I run the html in W3C, it returned with a few errors encountered in the title of the images, I fixed this by renaming the images title by using underscore to eliminate any existing space from the name; run the html files again and this time no errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator.

### CSS

- No errors were found when passing through the official (Jigsaw) validator.
