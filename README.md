## Testing
---

- I tested this page in different web browsers such as: Chrome, Firefox, Safari.
- I confirmed that this project is responsive, looks good and functions on all standard screen sizes using the DevTools device toolbar.
- I confirmed that the navigation, header, home, profile, gallery, and contact text are all rideable and easy to understand.
- I confirmed that the form works. It requires entries in every field, will only accept an email in the email field, and the submit button works.

## Bugs

### Solved bugs

- While testing the navegation menu before deploying my project to github, I noticed there was a problem when clicking on the profile menu from the contact one; instead of taking me to the correct destination, it took me to the home page instead.
- I discovered this was due when I copied the initial index.html file to the contact one, I forgot to update the href to "profile.html" within anchor element.
- Please refer below the code updated:


## Validator Testing

### HTML

### CSS

### Accessibility

- I confirmed that the colors and fonts chosen are easy to read and accessible by running lighthouse in DevTools.

### Deployment

The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are:

- In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab.
- From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch.
- Once the Master Branch has been selected, the page provided the link to the completed website.
